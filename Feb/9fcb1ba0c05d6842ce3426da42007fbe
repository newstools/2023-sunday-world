An 18-year-old is due at the Makwane magistrate’s court in Free State on charges of rape and murder of a 60-year-old woman. Police spokesperson Mmkao Mophiring said a six-year-old minor from Ditading village in Makwane, Qwaqwa came home from school and discovered the body of his granny covered in blood on the floor. “His mother and police arrived and found that the 60-year-old woman, who is the sister-in-law to the boy’s mother, had allegedly been murdered,” said Mophiring. “The deceased, who is a resident of the Thabong-Lusaka section of Makwane village, is believed to have also been raped.” During preliminary investigations, it was suspected that the 18-year-old boy from the same household could be involved. This because all the evidence found on the scene pointed to him, leading to his arrest.

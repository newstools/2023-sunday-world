The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has nothing to do with the arrest of Ace Magashule’s former personal assistant (PA) who is now based in the US. Moroadi Cholota was Magashule’s PA when the former ANC secretary-general was the premier of Free State. She will be appearing in a US court for contravening that country’s Immigration Act. This after Cholota was nabbed in Washington DC in January for overstaying her visit in the country after her student visa had expired. Brigadier Thandi Mbambo, spokesperson for the NPA, said: “The Hawks didn’t arrest Ms Cholota. The information at hand is that she was apparently arrested by the authorities from the USA for issues pertaining to her visa.” Christopher Singo, spokesperson for the Hawks in Free State, said: “She was arrested, but her arrest is not related to the Hawks or the asbestos case [in the Free State]. We can’t comment on her arrest.” Cholota is implicated in the controversial R255-million asbestos contract that was awarded to businessman Edwin Sodi and Igo Mpambani, also a businessman. Mpambani was shot execution-style in 2018 in Sandton, Johannesburg. At the time of his execution, the police confirmed that Mpambani had withdrawn huge sums of money from an ATM, but his murderers chose not to steal the money.

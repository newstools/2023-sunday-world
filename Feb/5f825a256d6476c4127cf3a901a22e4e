There is progress in search and rescue operations following floods that battered parts of Eastern Cape over a week ago. This after the body of an 18-year-old teenage girl, who was swept away by torrential rains when she tried to escape her flooded home through the window at Mapuzi village, was discovered. The search and rescue operations are being carried jointly by members of the SA National Defence Force, SA Navy divers, and the police in Coffee Bay, one of the towns battered by the floods. On Wednesday, it was reported that the floods death toll in the province had risen to 14.

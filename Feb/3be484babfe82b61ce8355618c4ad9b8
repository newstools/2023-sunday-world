Nondumiso Simelane has slammed rumours that her sister Babes Wodumo is broke just over two months after her husband was laid to rest. She was responding to a media report alleging that Babes, born Bongekile Simelane, has allegedly moved back home after she was left in debt by Mandla “Mampintsha” Maphumulo. According to the report, Nondumiso spilled the beans about her sister’s financial woes. Nondumiso wrote on social media: “Babes is self-employed. You guys are so used to women who suffer when their husbands are no more. “She has been in the papers for a long time, and whatever is written about her gives her the energy to work even harder.” <img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-254329 size-full" src="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/WhatsApp-Image-2023-02-27-at-09.55.43-e1677484617534.jpeg" alt="" width="720" height="915" srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/WhatsApp-Image-2023-02-27-at-09.55.43-e1677484617534.jpeg 720w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/WhatsApp-Image-2023-02-27-at-09.55.43-e1677484617534-197x250.jpeg 197w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/WhatsApp-Image-2023-02-27-at-09.55.43-e1677484617534-630x800.jpeg 630w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/WhatsApp-Image-2023-02-27-at-09.55.43-e1677484617534-150x191.jpeg 150w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/WhatsApp-Image-2023-02-27-at-09.55.43-e1677484617534-300x381.jpeg 300w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/WhatsApp-Image-2023-02-27-at-09.55.43-e1677484617534-600x763.jpeg 600w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/WhatsApp-Image-2023-02-27-at-09.55.43-e1677484617534-696x885.jpeg 696w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/WhatsApp-Image-2023-02-27-at-09.55.43-e1677484617534-330x420.jpeg 330w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/WhatsApp-Image-2023-02-27-at-09.55.43-e1677484617534-661x840.jpeg 661w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /> For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here.

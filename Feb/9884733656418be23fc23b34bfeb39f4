The Wife actor Linda Majola has closed his snack bar shop, thanks to rising interest rates and South Africa’s ailing economy. Writing on his social media account on Thursday, Majola publicly announced the end of his business journey, informing his followers that inflation has crippled his two-year old business. “Today I bid farewell to Humble Cafe. Inflation has proven to be the most crippling thing for us small business owners, and I’m sick in my stomach to have to close my doors. This is all I’ve ever had, my heart is aching,” he wrote. Majola opened Humble Cafe, a fast-food business, in January 2020. He told his fans at the time that the business operated fully while he also focused on shooting The Wife episodes. He also shared that he would cook when he was not working in front of a camera.      For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here. Or read the latest from Shwashwi here.

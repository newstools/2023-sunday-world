Valentine’s Day is a chance for people to express their love and affection. Preparing the best Valentine’s gifts for your loved ones is not as easy as one may think. The usually predictable gifts such as chocolate, flowers, or teddy bears can be too common. Although Valentine’s Day is for lovers, there are some cool limited edition Valentine’s Day sneakers that have dropped. Nike has dropped the Air force 1 Low and the Nike Dunk Low yellow heart, which is the official sneaker of the friend zone.   Converse has made a comeback and has dropped its elevated love Valentine’s Day 2023 collection. The limited edition Chuck tailors go for the gold with bright details made to shine with a mini red heart at the back heel. The kicks also have a V-Day-inspired All-Star patch that radiates all day long.   For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here. Or read the latest from Shwashwi here.

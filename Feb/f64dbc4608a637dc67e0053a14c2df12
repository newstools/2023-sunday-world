The ongoing attacks, sometimes fatal, in South African schools are a huge cause for concern for many parents, government, and teaching staff. This after the murder of a grade 10 pupil at Geluksdal Secondary School in Brakpan, east of Johannesburg on Thursday, who was stabbed during a fight with fellow learners. Frank Rumboll, headmaster at The Ridge School, said parents should remind their children to always prioritise safety in and out of school premises. “In 2023, safety awareness is more critical than ever for children. Whilst all efforts need to be taken to ensure a child’s safety, what is key today is awareness, and the responsibility for awareness lies with parents and it lives at schools,” said Rumboll. “The importance of feeling safe cannot be overstated in a child’s growth and development. A lack of safety, bullying concerns, and low teacher expectations can negatively impact learning. “Conversely, when a child feels safe and learns in a positive and secure environment, they are more motivated and willing to explore new ideas.” Rumboll emphasised the importance of open communication, healthy relationships and building courage in children for their overall safety. “Ensuring the safety of children should be a top priority for everyone involved in their lives. Parents, teachers, and communities must work together to create a safe environment for children to thrive, so that each child can reach their full potential.” Rumboll’s safety tips: Follow @SundayWorldZA on Twitter and @sundayworldza on Instagram, or like our Facebook Page, Sunday World, by clicking here for the latest breaking news in South Africa.

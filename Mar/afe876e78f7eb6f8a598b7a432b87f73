It’s the start of the new tax year and it’ll be worth your while to become a tax-savvy investor to ensure maximum benefit for your nest egg. What better way to start off the new tax year, which kicked off on March 1, than opening a tax-free investment account (TFIA) to gain as much benefit as possible from compound interest. A TFIA facility allows you to save R3 000 a month, R36 000 a year, and a maxim of R500 000 a lifetime without incurring tax on interest earned. First-time savers should not be intimidated by the initial amounts. Most people start off putting away R250 a month and gradually build up to reach the monthly R3 000. The trick is in starting and building momentum along the way. The beauty of TFIAs is that whatever interest you earn, the South African Revenue Service (Sars) won’t lay its hands on it. For long-term investors, this is awesome news as they would start seeing the magic of compound interest hard at work. Compound interest happens when you earn interest on interest, and Albert Einstein called it the eighth wonder of the world as it allows you to turbo-boost your investment. Dos and Don’ts of TFIA The amount you withdraw can’t be recontributed. You can open a TFIA for children but it’s not wise to make withdrawals as the amount can’t be recontributed as well. Avoid unnecessary penalties as any deposits above the annual R36 000 threshold will be taxed by SARS based on your tax rate. You should be guided by service charges on where to open your TFIA, and always think long term. It will take you almost 14 years to reach the lifetime limit of R500 000. You don’t want to enrich someone over the term of your TFIA with higher service charges. It pays to shop around.

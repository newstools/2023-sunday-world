One person has died and 21 other people were injured during an accident on the M71 near the Jukskei River in Lonehill, Johannesburg on Tuesday. According to emergency services, a 30-year-old man suffered fatal injuries and was declared dead on the scene. Multiple patients, believed to be commuters in another vehicle that crashed with a light delivery van, were treated for injuries ranging from moderate to serious before being rushed to hospitals around the city. The crash followed an accident that occurred on the M41 near Umhlanga in Durban on Monday. More than 50 vehicles were involved in the crash that left 16 people injured. The Road Freight Association (RFA) has called on relevant authorities to initiate a post-crash investigation to determine the cause of the crash. “The causes of such crashes need to be identified and then actively addressed. Notwithstanding the loss of life, injuries and loss of property, such scenes cannot be allowed to continue,” said the RFA. “Road users who choose to be non-compliant need to be held liable. “It is time that authorities clamp down on unroadworthy vehicles, reckless and negligent driving and those who use our roads in a selfish and illegal manner.” Follow @SundayWorldZA on Twitter and @sundayworldza on Instagram, or like our Facebook Page, Sunday World, by clicking here for the latest breaking news in South Africa.

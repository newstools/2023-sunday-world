Former Chelsea midfielder John Obi Mikel recalls how coaches used to get fired by the club’s former owner, Roman Abramovich. The Russian billionaire would first come in and scold the players in Russian, with an interpreter in tow. The next time Abramovich would fly in with his helicopter, Mikel and all the Chelsea players knew the writing was on the wall. “If we don’t do that (start playing well), the next time he comes in, he flies in with his helicopter to the training ground, and that’s it, we know that the manager is gone,” said Mikel. Abramovich hired and fired 15 managers during his 20 years as boss of “The Blues”. The new Chelsea owners, led by American billionaire Todd Boehly, are a patient lot. Before yesterday’s game against Leeds United, current manager Graham Potter’s Premier League record at Chelsea was: 18 games, 5 wins, 6 draws, and 7 defeats. The win percentage of 27.78% makes him the worst Chelsea manager in the Premier League era (since 1992). Abramovich would tear up Potter’s five-year contract, pay out millions, and move on as if nothing happened. Over in Egypt, Zamalek had 25 coaches in five years (from 2014–2019), with the controversial Mortada Mansour in charge. Trigger-happy Mansour once had seven coaches in just a year. Former Orlando Pirates coach Micho Sredojevic can attest to Mansour’s ruthlessness, as he was one of the “victims” and was fired after just 137 days about three years ago. South Africa has its own Abramovich or Mansour, and his name? Siviwe “Chippa” Mpengesi. “Once I see that the coach is not taking us in the right direction, he is taking us in the direction of destruction, I quickly act,” said Mpengesi some months ago, and added that the only coach he regrets firing was Manqoba Mngqithi, who was sacked 
after just two games. The last thing Mpengesi wants to see is Chippa United getting relegated, and he’s insisted that he’s not “proud” to fire coaches and that “it is not a nice thing to do”, but at the end of the day, the club comes first in his mind. Firing coaches also means paying huge settlements, which has affected the club’s finances, but that hasn’t stopped him from having close to 30 different coaches in just 11 years since their first promotion to the top flight in the 2012/13 season. Morgan Mammila is the latest to be shown the door by Mpengesi, and Kurt Lentjies, who helped the Chilli Boys retain its PSL status via the playoffs last season, is now back. Whether Lentjies can emulate Dan Malesela and become the club’s longest-serving coach (see sidebar) remains to be seen, but a betting man wouldn’t put his money on it.

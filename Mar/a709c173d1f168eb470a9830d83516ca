Tate Makgoe, the celebrated Free State MEC for education, will be laid to rest in Bloemfontein, Free State on Sunday. Makgoe was killed with his bodyguard, Warrant Officer Vuyo Mdi, when a car they were travelling in collided with cows on the N1 outside Bloemfontein at the weekend. The Free State provincial government has since set up a committee to arrange Makgoe’s funeral and a series of memorial services across the province. The MEC will be honoured at these services as a champion responsible for Free State’s remarkable matric results in recent years. The memorial services have been planned to run simultaneously from 11am on Wednesday in various district municipalities including Fezile Dabi, Xhariep, Lejweleputswa, and Thabo Mofutsanyana. The main memorial service will take place at 10am on Thursday at the University of Free State in Bloemfontein.

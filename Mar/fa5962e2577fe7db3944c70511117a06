Former chartered accountant Mark Vorster has been sentenced to six years in jail for defrauding the Unemployment Insurance Fund’s temporary employment relief scheme (UIF-TERS). According to the police, Vorster committed the crime at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic in August 2020. Police Captain Lloyd Ramovha said Vorster submitted fraudulent UIF-TERS claims on behalf of five companies that were using his services as an accountant and bookkeeper. “He did this without the knowledge nor consent from the companies’ directors,” said Ramovha. “Vorster unduly benefited just under R900 000 from the fraudulent transaction, which he used for his own benefit. “Almost half of the amount was preserved following a court order, but he had already spent the other amount.” Vorster was arrested in July 2021 and pleaded guilty on all eleven counts of fraud, two counts of theft, and one count of money-laundering. “The court has on Wednesday sentenced him to six years imprisonment. He has additionally been disbarred to practice as a chartered accountant in the future. “He was further ordered to pay back the amount he squandered from the Department of Employment and Labour.” Follow @SundayWorldZA on Twitter and @sundayworldza on Instagram, or like our Facebook Page, Sunday World, by clicking here for the latest breaking news in South Africa.

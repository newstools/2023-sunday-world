A case against a 33-year-old man suspected to have participated in the mass murder in Gqeberha in January has been postponed. The suspect appeared at the New Brighton magistrate’s court on Monday to answer to charges of murder. He was remanded in custody until his next appearance in court. Priscilla Naidu, spokesperson for the police, said the case was postponed to next week to allow the suspect to consult with his legal representative. Eight party-goers were gunned down in January by two unknown men. The suspects are said to have entered a house in Makanda Street in KwaZakhele and opened fire randomly at guests who were having fun at the party. Eight people including the host were fatally injured while other four people sustained gunshot wounds. The wounded were rushed to the hospital for treatment. Police Minister Bheki Cele, who visited the crime scene, vowed at the time that police officers would work around the clock to ensure that the gunmen were brought to book. The attack also got the attention of Eastern Cape premier Oscar Mabuyane, who expressed his sadness at “vicious and senseless mass killings” in the province. When gun-wielding criminals invade homes and randomly shoot at families, said the premier at the time, that does not only bring distraught to the family, but it injects fear and anxiety in the community. Mabuyane appealed to law-enforcement agencies to remain focused and treat each incident as a high priority. “Law-enforcement agencies must follow all leads to identify these criminals and bring them before the courts of law to face their crimes,” he said. The suspect will be identified once an identity parade has been conducted.

Mamelodi Sundowns wonderkid Cassius Mailula has made it in coach Hugo Broos’ Bafana Bafana preliminary squad. Broos announced his 35-men preliminary squad that will face Liberia in crucial back-to-back 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers later in March. Mailula has been the talk of town since making his debut for the Masandawana senior team in their 1-0 triumph against Chippa United in September 2022. The 21-year-old has since grabbed the opportunity with both hands, banging in eight goals so far this season, one shy from teammate Peter Shalulile and SuperSport United’s Bradley Grobler who are joint leading goalscorers. Kobamelo Kodisang, who plays for Moreirense in Portugal, is another notable inclusion. He joins Al Ahly’s Percy Tau and Burnley’s Lyle Foster who have also been picked to join the squad. The preliminary squad will be trimmed down to 23 players when Broos announces the final squad. 35-man preliminary squad: Goalkeepers: Ronwen Williams (Mamelodi Sundowns), Veli Mothwa (AmaZulu), Brandon Petersen (Kaizer Chiefs), Ricardo Goss (SuperSport United) Defenders: Nyiko Mobbie (Sekhukhune United), Khuliso Mudau (Mamelodi Sundowns), Siyanda Msani (Richards Bay FC), Innocent Maela (Orlando Pirates), Taariq Fielies (Cape Town City), Nkosinathi Sibisi (Orlando Pirates), Thapelo Morena (Mamelodi Sundowns), Aubrey Modiba (Mamelodi Sundowns), Grant Kekana (Mamelodi Sundowns), Mothobi Mvala (Mamelodi Sundowns), Siyanda Xulu (Turan Tovuz, Azerbaijan) Midfielders: Thapelo Maseko (SuperSport United), Miguel Timm (Orlando Pirates), Luke le Roux (Varberg BoIS, Sweden), Njabulo Blom (St Louis City, US), Sphephelo Sithole (Belenenses, Portugal), Sphelele Mkhulise (Mamelodi Sundowns), Grant Margeman (SuperSport United), Teboho Mokoena (Mamelodi Sundowns), Monnapule Saleng (Orlando Pirates), Khanyisa Mayo (Cape Town City), Pule Mmodi (Golden Arrows), Themba Zwane (Mamelodi Sundowns), Zakhele Lepasa (SuperSport United) Forwards: Cassius Mailula (Mamelodi Sundowns), Mihlali Mayambela (Aris Limassol, Cyprus), Bongokuhle Hlongwane (Minnesota FC, US), Fagrie Lakay (Pyramids, Egypt), Lyle Foster (Burnley, England), Percy Tau (Al Ahly, Egypt), Kobamelo Kodisang (Moreirense, Portugal) For the latest sport news from Sunday World, click here.

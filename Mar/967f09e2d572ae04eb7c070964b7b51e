At the back of an impressive start to their two-match Test series against West Indies, it goes without saying that the Proteas still have their sight set on securing a qualification for the ICC Cricket World Cup later in 2023. The Proteas emerged victorious when they bowled out the West Indies out for 159 runs in the second innings to win the first Test by 87 runs at SuperSport Park in Centurion, Pretoria on Thursday afternoon. It all began with a spectacular century by star batsman Aiden Markram in the first innings, when he recorded 116 runs from 47 balls to put the home side in the driving seat. His solid performance was followed by the heroics of fast bowlers Kagiso Rabada and Anrich Nortje, who were ruthless with the ball to inspire the Proteas to the winning the five-day Test within three days. Nortje registered his fourth Test five while Rabada picked up six wickets in the second innings. Rabada is now among the elite bowlers, as he reached a 100-wickets milestone in the ICC World Test Championship, becoming just the fifth bowler to reach the landmark in the history of the tournament. South Africa have been mysteriously struggling to deliver in major tournaments, having crashed out of the ICC T20 World Cup in Australia in August 2022, after succumbing to a shock defeat to the Netherlands. The Proteas saw their automatic qualifying take a knock after they were penalised one point for maintaining a slow over-rate against England in the third ODI in Kimberley in February. South Africa are currently occupying position nine in the Cricket World Cup Super League standings with 78 points. With the current cycle of the 2023 Cricket World Cup Super League almost over and one more qualifying spot vacant, South Africa have it all to fight for with West Indies (88 points), who are presently on position eight. Sri Lank have 77 points followed by Ireland with 68 points. The South Africans have five matches remaining, with two of those games being against the Netherlands on March 31 and April2, respectively. Newly appointed Test coach Shukri Conrad alongside captain Temba Bavuma have a tough task at hand to lead South Africa to the ICC World Cup in India later in the year.

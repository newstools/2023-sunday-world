The PCC will during the Month of March continue with a series of sectors engagement to consolidate its programme of bringing together views, comments and concerns to shape the country’s Just Energy Transition.   These dialogues will look at the financial needs and gaps for a just transition; some of the financial resources available for South Africa to finance a just transition; and the opportunities available for South Africa to finance a just transition. The commission calls upon all partners to participate in the ongoing consultations on the review of the 2017 Integrated Resource Plan to enable it to draft set of recommendations to be made to government on the energy mix and governance to be finalised at the end of March 2023.

Gonarezhou is a Zimbabwean anti-poaching film, highlighting pressing issues around animal exploitation, particularly elephants and rhinos often hunted for their tusks. The aim is to raise awareness of the high rise of poaching seen across Africa as well as to acknowledge and celebrate the efforts of the brave men and women who put their lives on the line to protect our animals and heritage.

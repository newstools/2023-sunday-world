AmaZulu midfielder George Maluleka is wary of the threat Dondol Stars pose ahead of their Nedbank Cup round of 16 encounter on Wednesday night. Dondol, who ply their football in the Gauteng ABC Motsepe League, became the first lower-division side to cause an upset in the “giant slaying” tournament. The Pretoria-based outfit came from a goal down to stun coach Gavin Hunt’s SuperSport United during their Nedbank Cup opener. Maluleka admitted that they have a tough task ahead of them and knows a thing or two about their opponents. “Dondol is not going to be an easy opponent, we’ve seen a couple of their clips. I think also in the SuperSport match, we saw that they are not afraid of playing.” Maluleka said. “It is going to be an interesting one, but I think if we can just apply ourselves and approach the game without undermining our opposition, then we should be able to pull through.” The former Kaizer Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns playmaker said that they are aware of the history of the tournament, but will not focus on that heading into the game. “We are aware of the history of the tournament, David and Goliath, but like I said, I don’t think we should [keep] that in mind, the approach should be like any other game.” Meanwhile, Usuthu celebrated their first three points in over a month when they beat Chippa United 2-0 in a league match on Sunday. Their last league victory was against Kaizer Chiefs early in January, when they handed them a whooping 4-0 defeat. The win was followed by a string of draws and a loss to TS Galaxy. Kick-off is at 7.30pm at the FNB Stadium after the fixture was moved due to extraordinary circumstances. For the latest sport news from Sunday World, click here.

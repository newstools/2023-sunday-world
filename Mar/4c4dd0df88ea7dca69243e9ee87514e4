SA mining magnate and billionaire Patrice Motsepe has pledged to get involved in the resuscitation of the Transnet School of Excellence. In his quest, he will work in tandem with Gauteng premier Panyaza Lesufi to revive the historic institution that was once a conveyor belt of talent for Mzansi football. Motsepe, who is the president of African football mother body CAF, made this declaration after the Motsepe Foundation announced it would sponsor schools sport and choral music with a whopping R150-million. In December, the rail and port company pulled their longstanding sponsorship off the school. The school is a shadow of its former self and is in dire need of financial assistance to get back to its former glory days. The institution has produced PSL and Bafana stars such as Steven Pienaar, Gabriel “Ninja” Mofokeng, Bernard Parker, Masilo Modabi, Daine Klate, Dillon Sheppard, Shaun Potgieter, Lucky Maselesele and Andile Cele among others. Said Motsepe: “I want to say thank you to the premier (Lesufi) for raising this thing of the School of Excellence. There are some other people that I know, we will get them to try and help – thanks as well to Danny Jordaan, the Safa president, for the input and information. The School of Excellence was such an important institution.” Follow @SundayWorldZA on Twitter and @sundayworldza on Instagram, or like our Facebook Page, Sunday World, by clicking here for the latest breaking news in South Africa.

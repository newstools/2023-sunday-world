A man from Mpumalanga has publicly admitted to killing his biological father after the father failed to support his decision to pursue a career in music. On Tuesday, the Mpumalanga High Court in Mbombela sentenced Siphamandla Khumalo to life in jail for stabbing the businessman to death. According to the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), the 22-year-old convict pleaded guilty to butchering his father, Bheki Khumalo, who lived with him in Mayflower. NPA regional spokesperson Monica Nyuswa said the accused told the court that his relationship with the deceased became sour after he did not support his decision to become a musician. “His father wanted him to pursue a career in engineering, as a result the accused felt that the deceased was a stumbling block towards his dream career and then left his family home in Mayflower [and travelled] to Ermelo, where the deceased was conducting [his] business. “He armed himself with a knife and waited for the deceased to arrive, then produced a knife and fatally stabbed him in the neck,” said Nyuswa. The NPA encouraged people to seek professional help when they encounter similar challenges in their families.

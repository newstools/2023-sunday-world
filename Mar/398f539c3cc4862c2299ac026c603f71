Entries for the Miss South Africa pageant will officially open on Monday, 13 March 2023 at 3pm. This year the competition will have new additions which will be announced when the entries officially open. CEO of the Miss South Africa Organisation, Stephanie Weil, said the pageant has become known in the global space and they are constantly striving to keep the competition relevant and fresh. “While we are ensuring the Miss South Africa campaign loses none of the attributes fans and followers have come to love, we’ve also challenged ourselves to think bigger and better to make certain the Miss South Africa competition grows and evolves and retains relevance and interest in an ever-changing world,” said Weil.

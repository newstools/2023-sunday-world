Radio personality Moeti “Mo Flava” Tsiki dropped his mic on Wake Up On Metro FM breakfast show on Tuesday morning. The commercial station announced his departure last week and said his last day would be on Friday. Mo Flava was with the station for the last eight years.  The seasoned presenter took to his social media on Tuesday to share that it was his last show with the station. Mo Flava also shared how surreal it was and did not know how he’s supposed to feel. “Today will be my last show on Metro FM. I don’t know how a last show is supposed to sound like so I guess we’ll freestyle,” he wrote.  On the other hand, Podcaster MacGyver ‘MacG’ Mukwevho hinted that his beef with Mo Flava was far from over after he took jabs on his departure from Metro. He stated that anything that he attempts after leaving the breakfast show will be a downgrade. “Am I a bad person for being happy that Moflava got fired? I was so happy, ” he told Sol Phenduka.

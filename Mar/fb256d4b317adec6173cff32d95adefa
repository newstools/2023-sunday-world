The much anticipated Metro FM Music Awards has been postponed to 6 May. The announcement was made by the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC)and Mpumalanga province on Tuesday. The stakeholders shared that the change was necessitated by circumstances beyond their control. SABC Group Executive: Radio Nada Wotshela said: “The SABC apologies to the public that they will have to wait an extra week to witness the return of this highly anticipated event. We are aware that there is a lot of interest in the awards and we promise the public that they won’t be disappointed with the world-class broadcasting production”. In January Metro FM launched the comeback of the awards at The Capital Hotel in Mbombela. Due to the outbreak of Covid-19, the awards had to take a back seat for a brief period. The ceremony is expected to be held in Mbombela and will be broadcast live on SABC1 and various SABC radio stations. They will also be streamed live on SABC Plus and Metro FM’s YouTube channel. The Head of the Department for Culture, Sport and Recreation, Godfrey Ntombela said as a province they are excited to once again partner with Metro FM. “The opportunity to host this major event comes at the right time and we are hopeful that it will benefit the creative industry and promote tourism in the Province,” said Ntombela.

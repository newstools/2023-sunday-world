The City of Johannesburg is facilitating relief after a raging fire razed to the ground shacks in Roodepoort, west of Johannesburg on Sunday. The shack fire, according to the city’s emergency services, left more than 100 people destitute. Emergency services spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi told Sunday World on Monday that the shack fire erupted in Emhlangeni informal settlement on Sunday afternoon. “About 11 shacks were totally destroyed by this fire incident, leaving about 100 people displaced. No injuries or fatalities were reported during this incident,” Mulaudzi said. “Officials from City of Johannesburg disaster management have been activated to start facilitating relief for affected families.” He said the cause of the fire is being investigated and encouraged the residents, especially the people living in informal settlements, to always look after their heating devices. “Do not leave them [heating devices] unattended while in use to prevent fire incidents like this one,” Mulaudzi said.

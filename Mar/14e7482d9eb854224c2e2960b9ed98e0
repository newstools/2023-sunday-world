Mamelodi Sundowns will be giving away free tickets ahead of their Caf Champions League second leg encounter against Al Ahly at the Loftus Versfeld Stadium on Saturday. The reigning DStv Premiership champions have since urged supporters to come out in numbers and rally behind the team. All supporters who will be wearing yellow on that day will be granted free entry.  Masandawana held the Egyptian giants to a thrilling 2-2 draw during their first leg meeting at the Al-Salam Cairo Stadium two weeks ago, thanks to goals from Peter Shalulile and Thapelo Morena. The much-anticipated ‘African derby’ clash will also see the return of Bafana Bafana forward Percy Tau, who left the Tshwane-based side for English Premier League outfit Brighton in 2018. Sundowns are currently leading Group B with seven points, three points ahead of their African archrivals who are occupying position three with four points. Victory will see coach Rulani Mokwena’s charges qualify for the knockout rounds. Despite their domestic football dominance, Masandawana seems to find it hard to replicate their success at the continental stage. Continental glory is surely on the cards for the Brazilians, having last won the prestigious club competition in 2016 under coach Pitso Mosimane. The Tshwane giants are yet to reach the final since then, leaving Mokwena under pressure to go all the way and deliver another star for Sundowns.

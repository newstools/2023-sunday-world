Skeem Saam actor Thabiso Molokomme and The River’s Lunathi Mampofu both scooped the viewer’s choice awards at the sixth Royalty Soapie awards on Saturday evening at The Galleria in Sandton. This year the Royalty Soapie Awards partnered with South African Tourism, to promote Tourism in South Africa both locally and globally. The awards are a celebration of an industry that showcases and emphasizes the importance of storytelling in our lives. Winnie Ntshaba, founder and CEO of the awards, said she was proud to celebrate the diverse calibre of nominations from across the continent. “Our strategic collaboration with South African Tourism is significant as it buoys our local talent and elevates them on the international stage. Since the soapies are filmed locally, they showcase Mzansi’s beautiful landscapes, infrastructure, and talent. The sixth-year milestone has been a fantastic journey, a dream coming to fruition. As an actress, I am super excited about a new relationship that will bring inclusion of the Pan African Actors.  A platform where we celebrate the hard work of individuals behind the soapie industry across Africa.” Three lucky public voters had a chance to rub shoulders with the who’s who of the entertainment industry and loved the red-carpet experience. The glitz and glam of the red carpet special and the awards ceremony will broadcast on 25 March 2023 at 8pm on SABC 1.

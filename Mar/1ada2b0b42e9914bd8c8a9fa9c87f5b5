Eskom will ease loadshedding this week as a result of a recovery in generation capacity, the power utility has said.  In a statement on Monday, the state-owned entity said it will no longer implement stage-five rolling power cuts, stating that stage four will continue until further notice. Eskom further said it will provide an update as soon as significant changes occur. Loadshedding was expected to alternate between stages four and five during the day and at evening peak period, respectively. However, as has been the case for years, the grid remains volatile and unpredictable, so the loadshedding stages and schedules can change at short notice, it said. South Africa has experienced the worst levels of loadshedding on record since late last year, and concerns have been raised that the country could to struggle going into winter. The average stages of loadshedding have also been much higher in 2023 compared to any other year, with South Africa mostly being at or above stage four since January. Loadshedding has cost companies millions of rands, with groups including Shoprite and MTN reporting over half a billion rands in losses due to outages. The government and Eskom have conceded that the energy crisis is only likely to improve in 18 to 24 months, giving very little hope that any significant reprieve will be felt in the short term Follow @SundayWorldZA on Twitter and @sundayworldza on Instagram, or like our Facebook Page, Sunday World, by clicking here for the latest breaking news in South Africa.

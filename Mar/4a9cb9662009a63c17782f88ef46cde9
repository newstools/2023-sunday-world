Free State police have shut a clandestine drug-manufacturing laboratory and seized mandrax tablets with a street value of about R1-million. The discovery of the laboratory was made on Sunday following the arrest of a 37-year-old man who was found in possession of mandrax tablets. The suspect, who was arrested in East Burger Street in Bloemfontein, is expected to make an appearance in court soon. He has been charged with manufacturing illegal drugs and possession of drugs. An additional charge of contravention of the Immigration Act was also added when the case was opened at Parkweg police station. Lieutenant-Colonel Thabo Covane said when the police stopped and searched the man, they found a transparent plastic bag containing 1 000 mandrax tablets in his backpack. “The team then requested the suspect’s travelling document which he claimed that it was at his residential place,” Covane said. “The suspect directed the squad to Tielmanroos Street in Olive Hill in the Navalsig police station area where police officers discovered a clandestine drug laboratory in the backyard of a plot.” At the plot, drug-manufacturing equipment was discovered and confiscated including an unidentified powder, crystalised drain cleaner, 10 litres of brown liquid believed to be used to manufacture the drugs, as well as cutting agents. “A total of 17 packages containing mandrax tablets and another open package containing 574 tablets were also seized.” Free State provincial police commissioner, Lieutenant-General Baile Motswenyane, commended the vigilance of the team that led to the discovery of the clandestine laboratory and the seizure of drugs. Motswenyane encouraged “all the foot soldiers” to continue to work hard in their efforts to rid Free State’s streets of drugs.

Entries for the 2023 SA Music Awards (Sama) have opened after the drama that unfolded during the last edition when artists accused judges of failing them. Several musicians including Zakes Bantwini and Makhadzi slammed the awards in 2022 saying there was no integrity in the way in which the show was produced. However, the Recording Industry of South Africa (RiSA) has invited musicians to submit entries again for the 29th instalment of the Sama. Entries opened on Monday. RiSA CEO Nhlanhla Sibisi said the entries have been on an upward trajectory in the last five years, noting that the awards’ 2022 edition set a record with over 1 300 submissions. “This has been a satisfying vote of confidence in the Sama and our systems by the music recording community,” Sibisi said. “We look forward to Sama29 continuing that trend. The music industry has been bustling with new releases across genres and now the time has come to reward excellence.” With over 30 genre categories, submissions can be made on RiSA’s website on www.samusicawards.co.za or hand delivered to its offices in Randburg, Johannesburg. The closing date is at midnight on April 14.       For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here. Or read the latest from Shwashwi here.

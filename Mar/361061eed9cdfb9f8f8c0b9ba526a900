Monday, March 6 Stage 4: midnight to 4pm Stage 5: 4pm to midnight Tuesday, 7 March Stage 5: midnight to 5am Stage 4: Until further notice Meanwhile, the Presidency has confirmed that President Cyril Ramaphosa will announce the long-awaited cabinet reshuffle changes, which will see the introduction of a new minister of electricity. The minister will be responsible to deal with the ongoing dreaded loadshedding and energy crisis that cripples the economy of the country. Despite promising to deal with the energy crisis with urgency, the president has prolonged the introduction of the minister for almost a month. In February, the government declared the energy crisis a national state of disaster and gazetted wide-reaching regulations that will empower various government departments to fast-track new generation builds and deal with different aspects of the crisis. To date no such action has been taken. South Africa has experienced near-permanent loadshedding, mostly at stage four or higher since September 2022. Loadshedding has been implemented for 127 consecutive days.

Chickens have come home to roost for a 54-year-old woman who defrauded scores of people five years ago. The suspect, who has been on the run since 2017, was arrested on arrival at OR Tambo International Airport in Kempton Park, east of Johannesburg on Sunday and was due at the Louis Trichardt magistrate’s court in Mpumalanga on Monday. This after she allegedly defrauded unsuspecting job seekers and persons aspiring to acquire nursing qualifications. Police spokesperson in Limpopo, Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo, said the suspect allegedly owned bogus nursing colleges and fraudulently registered unsuspecting students under the pretext that they will acquire a diploma in nursing. “The victims were also assured of employment across the province [Limpopo] upon completion of their studies,” said Mojapelo. “The suspect’s fraudulent dealings were unmasked when it was eventually discovered that the colleges were not authentic.” The students immediately opened cases of fraud and theft against the woman in Polokwane, Morebeng, Thohoyandou, Waterval and various other places in Gauteng. She managed to evade arrest and has been on the run since 2017 after she fled to Nigeria. “A breakthrough was made on Saturday, March 10, when the detectives from Makhado [in Limpopo] received information about a wanted suspect returning to South Africa from Nigeria, and that she would be arriving at OR Tambo International Airport at midday.” She was spotted at the airport and the police officers pounced on her.

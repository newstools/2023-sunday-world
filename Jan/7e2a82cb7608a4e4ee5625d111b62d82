Gauteng premier Panyaza Lesufi confirmed on Wednesday that the Boksburg tanker explosion death toll has risen to 41. “Sadly the death toll in the Boksburg explosion now stands at 41. We extend our sincerest condolences to the families and relatives of the deceased. The police, I am briefed, are ready to take the matter back to court,” he wrote on his social media account. Panyaza added that an investigation into the matter has been completed and the docket has been forwarded to the authorities for a decision. The driver of the truck, which got stuck under the bridge before exploding on December 24 2022, faces charges of negligence, damage to property and culpable homicide. He is out of jail pending the finalisation of the investigation. The 32-year-old driver was en-route to Botswana from Richards Bay when he allegedly took the wrong exit to get onto the N17 highway leading him to Railway Street in Boksburg. Last week, the Gauteng department of health held a healing service in memory of the 12 healthcare workers from the Tambo Memorial Hospital who died as a result of the explosion. Addressing the memorial service, Mavis Malekane, nursing manager at Tambo Memorial Hospital, said with the loss of experienced maternal nurses, it will be difficult to improve the indicator of mortality rate. “Even if we were to employ more nurses today, their experiences will never be replaced. Losing experienced nurses left us with a gap that will be difficult to close,” she said. Lesufi said last week that his administration will continue to support the families whose lives have changed forever due to the tragedy, and implored healthcare professionals to give the best care to those still on the road to recovery.

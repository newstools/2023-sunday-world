North West police have launched a manhunt for suspects who got away with an undisclosed amount of cash following a cash-in-transit heist. National police spokesperson Athlenda Mathe said the heavily armed gang approached a Fidelity van on the N12 between Wolmaransstad and Klerksdorp early on Thursday. The suspects, travelling in four vehicles, used one of their cars to ram into the Fidelity van and brought it to a standstill. “The suspects [then] allegedly bombed the van, took an undisclosed amount of cash and fled the scene,” said Mathe. “They reportedly fled the scene with three vehicles, which include a gold-coloured car and two VW Polos.” Mathe added that the gang also disarmed and robbed the Fidelity guards of their service firearms before vanishing into thin air. “The road was closed while police conducted investigations and two rifles have since been recovered. We urge the community to report the suspects when they spot them and [we] would like to also warn that harbouring criminals is a criminal offence.” Follow @SundayWorldZA on Twitter and @sundayworldza on Instagram, or like our Facebook Page, Sunday World, by clicking here for the latest breaking news in South Africa.

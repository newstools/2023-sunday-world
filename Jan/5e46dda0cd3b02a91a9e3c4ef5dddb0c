Creators from across sub-Saharan Africa recently gathered at the Mövenpick Hotel and Residences in Nairobi, Kenya following an eight-day long competitive voting process on TikTok. At the inaugural awards, the African TikTok creators were crowned among the Top Creators and Top Creator Runner Ups. The ceremony was for the recognition and awarding of content creators across sub-Saharan Africa for the content and creativity that they put in their work in 2022. TikTok’s content programming lead, sub-Saharan Africa, Boniswa Sidwaba, said the award ceremony is TikTok’s way of shining a light and recognising storytellers, their creativity and the positive impact that all creators bring to the TikTok community. “We are thrilled to be celebrating our creators who have been a driving force behind some of the exciting trends for 2022,” shared Sidwaba. “With these inaugural awards, TikTok aims to give creators in sub-Saharan Africa the recognition they deserve and to encourage them to tell the African story while spreading joy at all times.” Among the content creator winners is South African commercial pilot @Pilot_onthegram and Lindokuhle Khoza @.lindokuhle_khoza  For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here.

Mbali Monica Hlongwane, who is known as Mbali Vibes, has been crowned the winner of Smirnoff 1818 Shaya Ingoma Top 10 Female DJ Search 2023. This comes after months of tough competition from Mzansi’s talented female DJs. The number of contenders was shortened to the top 10 in December before the selection of the skhokho of the decks on December 31. The selections were done by three judges – DJ “Pruluv” Prudence Mathebula from Metro FM, DJ Slender “The Dancing DJ” from KwaZulu-Natal, and Oscar Mdlongwa, known as Oskido. Mbali Vibes, who is from Protea Glen in Soweto, got more than 6-million votes via www.shayaingoma1818.co.za to win the competition. She walked away with R50 000 in cash, DJ equipment valued at R50 000, a trip to the Miami Winter Music Festival 2023 valued at more than R300 000, three months to build her profile nationally and internationally, and will get an opportunity to feature at the Smirnoff 2023 event. She said the competition has been an amazing experience, noting that it was fantastic to meet a phenomenal range of deejaying talent from across the country. “I am humbled and really honoured to emerge as the winner of this year’s competition. Thanks to Smirnoff 1818 for providing a platform such as this to unearth and profile Mzansi’s top-tier female DJ talent,” said Hlongwane. Each of the other top 10 finalists received R25 000 in cash and DJ equipment to the value of R15 000.

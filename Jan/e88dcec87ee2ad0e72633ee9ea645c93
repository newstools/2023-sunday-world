A 31-year-old woman from George in Western Cape will appear in the George magistrate’s court on Tuesday, for allegedly assaulting a toddler. Police Spokesperson Sergeant Christopher Spies said that on Tuesday, 27 December 2022 the mother of the two-year-old boy had left him in the care of relatives at Rosedale near Pacaltsdorp in George and on her return noticed injuries to his face. He had an open wound and bruises around the eyes inflicted with an unknown object. The boy was taken for medical treatment to the local hospital and medical personnel summoned police. The mother’s relative was arrested on a charge of child abuse. Meanwhile, the Oudtshoorn Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences (FCS) unit said in a statement that it arrested a 31-year-old man on Monday on a charge of assault with the intent to commit grievous bodily harm and child abuse. “It is alleged that the suspect assaulted his one-year-old boy on Saturday, 24 December 2022 at Heideblom Lane, Bridgeton in Oudtshoorn. The accused made his first court appearance on Wednesday, 28 December 2022 on the mentioned charge. The case was postponed to 4 January for further investigation. He was remanded in custody.” Western Cape police management has since asked the public to refrain from circulating a video of the incident that has been shared on various social media platforms. This to protect the identity of the child.

Yonda Thoma’s wife, Taz Emeran, took to Instagram and penned a heartfelt message to him expressing how much she is blessed to call him her husband. “My husband knows I appreciate him because I make it a point to tell him that every day. But today I’d like to extend it. To say he’s my pillar of strength would be an understatement. He leads with such intensity but isn’t afraid to follow. He loves hard but has a gentle way about him,” she wrote. Emeran expressed how he gives her a sense of security both physical and emotional. “He truly is everything that my heart needs. I could have never imagined that one day I would be blessed enough to call my best friend my husband, but God saw fit to spoil me with the best gift. Thank you, Lord, for answering a prayer I never knew I needed.” The duo tied the knot in April 2022.  For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here.

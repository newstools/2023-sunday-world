The popular Cape Town eatery, Homespun by Matt Restaurant, owned by Matt Schreuder, is at the centre of a racism storm after its employees complained of being subjected to racial and abusive slurs by their boss. This comes at a time when Schreuder allegedly wrote a derogatory message, using foul language directed at a female employee, using expletives like “a b***h”. According to employees, Schreuder lost his temper after the female employee resigned last week, and during his rage he called her a “stupid f****g c**t”. In the message posted on LinkedIn, Lance F, the brother of the woman allegedly insulted, wrote that he was heart-broken by how his sister was treated by Schreuder. “It is with a heavy heart that I am making this post. My sister has been struggling in her work as they were under-staffed constantly. She works for a restaurant called Homespun by Matt. Finally, she couldn’t take it anymore and decided for her sanity and physical wellbeing it was better she quit. “There is no excuse for bullying and aggression. “You, as a grown man in a country plagued with gender-based violence, should understand this. “I hope one day you grow up,” Lance F, a financial manager at Acciona Energy South Africa, wrote. In the screen shot of the message allegedly penned by Schreuder on WhatsApp to the woman, he wrote: “You are a stupid f****g C**T!!! Good riddance to bad rubbish…you miserable b***h!” Since the matter has gone viral, a former employee, Mike Shawarira, alleges he also experienced racism at the hands of Schreuder. He said he started working as a waiter at Homespun by Matt in October 2021. “I endured insults from Matt himself, including some by white and Chinese customers, who called me a monkey.” Shawarira also alleges Schreuder took their tips, justifying the keeping of the tips by boasting that he spent millions of rand to build the business and was therefore entitled to do as he pleased. “I made almost R40 000 a month in tips, but I was only paid R18 000,” said Shawarira. The restaurant manager, known as Janine, who refused to give us her full name, said: “We will respond whenever we wish, at the present, the boss is too busy to respond.” When Sunday World called Janine for the third time on the restaurant landline number, requesting that she give the phone to Schreuder, she said: “As I told you earlier, I am not in a position to speak to you.” She then hung up.

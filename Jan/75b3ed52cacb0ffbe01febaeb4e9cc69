It is officially back to school for inland provinces and parents have taken to social media to share pictures of their children who started formal schooling on Wednesday. However, the parents were cautious not to identify the schools in order to shield the little ones from child trafficking. As some children shed tears on realising that they were being separated from their parents and guardians, others welcomed a new chapter in their lives. Some parents also had one or two things to share about the experience, and also complained about expensive school uniforms and stationary.  On Tuesday, Gauteng MEC for education Matome Chiloane said the department was working to place the remaining 1 394 learners in the classrooms. “We are working around the clock, we are engaging our schools. We are continuing to place our learners. When we started, we had 292 145 complete applications,” said Chiloane. “These are the parents who were able to provide all the necessary documentation and also met the deadline. We also had incomplete applications.”     For more education news from Sunday World, click here.

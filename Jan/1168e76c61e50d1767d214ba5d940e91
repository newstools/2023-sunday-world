Self-proclaimed king of AmaZulu Simakade KaZwelithini has appealed for assistance in footing the bill for his legal bid to dethrone his brother and current heir to the throne King MisuZulu kaZwelithini. In a statement on Tuesday, Simakade is appealing for monetary donations from those who back his quest to be recognised as the legitimate heir to the throne. “Simakade kaZwelithini Foundation hereby requests donations, big or small, for legal fees on the kingship dispute. Working together, victory is certain,” the foundation said in a statement. Despite President Cyril Ramaphosa invoking section 8 (3) (a) and (b) of the Traditional and Khoi-San Leadership Act and legally recognising MisuZulu as the undisputed king of the more than 11-million Zulu people, Simakade believes the head of state granted himself unduly powers and took away the customary right of the royal house to choose its preferred king. He also argues that the president’s decision did not take into consideration the recommendations contained in what has become known as the Mchunu panel chaired by former KwaZulu-Natal premier Willies Mchunu. The legal matter is expected to be heard on May 31 at the high court in Pretoria. The king is regarded as a public servant with a monthly salary equivalent to that of the chief director in the public service. In addition, the AmaZulu royal house is allocated an annual budget in excess of millions of rands for the luxury and the upkeep of the royals.

The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) has confirmed that all its grant beneficiaries will be paid this week. The old-age grants will be paid on Tuesday followed by disability grants on Wednesday, the agency said, noting that the payment of other grants will be effected from Thursday. Moabi Pitsi, spokesperson for Sassa, said the agency experienced technical glitches in November and December that affected the payment of social grants. “Those issues have been cleared. We can confirm to our clients that the old-age grant, the disability grant and child support grants will be paid from January 3 to January 5,” Pitsi said. Meanwhile, all the Sassa gold card holders have been advised to withdraw their grants at any retail outlet that offers cash-back services including Shoprite, Checkers, Usave, Pick n Pay and Boxer stores. In November, Sassa apologised to its beneficiaries using gold cards after they were unable to withdraw money at post office branches nationwide. This after the post office outlets experienced glitches in their systems affecting all Postbank customers wishing to make over-the-counter payments, deposits and withdrawals.

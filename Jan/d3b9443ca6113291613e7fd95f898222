Seven suspects are due at a magistrate’s court in Standerton, Mpumalanga on Thursday after they were nabbed and charged with housebreaking, possession of unlicensed firearms and illegal possession of suspected drugs. The men, aged between 25 and 40, were arrested during a joint operation by the police’s crime prevention unit, community policing forum, and the detective services unit in the area. Police spokesperson Colonel Donald Mdhluli said the joint operation also managed to recoup suspected stolen electrical appliances including two laptops, four plasma TVs, a bag full of clothing and drugs. The total value of the recovered items is estimated to be above R100 000. Last week, during Operation Vala Konke, Standerton police confiscated tik, nyaope, dagga and 319 litres of liquor.

Cash-strapped power utility Eskom has ramped up rolling blackouts to stage three starting at 4pm on Wednesday, it said earlier in the day, noting that stage three will carry on until further notice. Eskom attributed the latest change in loadshedding stages to the breakdown of two generating units and a delay in returning three other units from planned maintenance. The state-owned enterprise said it will issue an update as soon as it becomes necessary. Loadshedding has been rolling at stage two since last week. In December, Andre de Ruyter announced his resignation as the CEO of Eskom on the back of worsening power cuts. However, the power utility said at the time that the outgoing chief executive had agreed to avail himself until March 2023 while it searches for his replacement. Leadership has become the most controversial aspect at Eskom, as it battles an energy crisis that subjects the whole country to rampant rolling blackouts. During its appearance in parliament in 2022, MPs called on the government to restructure and transform the cash-strapped power utility. As Eskom searches for what it calls a “suitably qualified leader”, appeals have been growing louder for the swift appointment of a new leadership. Western Cape premier Alan Winde said in December that President Cyril Ramaphosa must ensure that the new Eskom boss will satisfy the needs and expectations of the nation. “I urgently call on President Cyril Ramaphosa to outline how he will prioritise and ensure a fit-for-purpose Eskom leader that will deliver the energy plan as promised and needed by this province and country,” Winde said after the resignation of De Ruyter.

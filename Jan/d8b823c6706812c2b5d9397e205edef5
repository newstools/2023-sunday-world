The police in Mpumalanga will bring to book the unknown suspects who robbed a fuel station and a tourist centre in Graskop, provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Semakaleng Daphney Manamela has vowed. A group of 20 armed men who had their faces covered with balaclavas reportedly stormed into the fuel station on Tuesday night and robbed staff at gunpoint. The area is regarded as one of top tourist destinations in the province. “The suspects posed as clients who wanted to refill at the fuel station at midnight. However, when fuel attendants offered their assistance, the suspects reportedly held them at gunpoint, tying all of them with cable ties,” said police spokesperson Brigadier Selvy Mohlala. “The cashier who was also held hostage was reportedly ordered to point out where the drop-in safe was.” It is alleged that the suspects detonated explosives to open the safe before escaping with an undisclosed amount of cash. Mohlala added that the suspects proceeded to a tourist centre a few metres away from the fuel station. “The suspects held a security guard at gunpoint, tied him with cable ties and disabled the alarm system. They accessed the building and detonated some explosives to access cash from the safe.” The amount of cash stolen from the tourist centre is also unknown and the police are investigating.

One of Joburg’s popular entertainment spot Leano Restaurant and Live Music in Braamfontein has shut down. Leano, which is 100% black-owned, is said to have closed its doors to patrons in December and did not reopen in the new year. Co-owner and manager of Leano Keitumetse Molatlhegi said the business has had to deal with various challenges since its establishment in 2021. It was after an event on December 18 that it became clear that the business was not sustainable. The statement further states that the business was negatively impacted by loadshedding. The owners also struggled to get an investment partner, as well as the support from the public and private sectors. “While this closure affects my partner and I, it also negatively impacts the young people whom we were giving an opportunity to make a living over the year of our operation,” said Molatlhegi. “This closure also affects the creatives that we partnered with and gave a platform to share their craft with our audience. Finally, it impacts the patrons through various relationships and stakeholders within the community.” Molatlhegi extended his gratitude to patrons and creatives for their unwavering support over the past year.

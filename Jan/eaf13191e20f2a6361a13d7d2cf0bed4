The search for Sheba, the tigress that went on a rampage in Walkerville, on the south of Johannesburg this week has come to a sad end after the big cat was euthanised. The eight-year-old Sheba had escaped from an enclosure at the weekend and caused panic in and around Johannesburg as reports emerged that the animal was behaving violently. Gresham Mandy, Walkerville Community Policing Forum (CPF) representative, said reports were received of activity on the Arboretum Farm at Walkers Fruit Farms early on Wednesday morning. “She had entered a farm area with six dwellings and with families living there. Sheba attacked and killed one of the domestic animals, and a call was made for urgent assistance. CPF members responded to the scene and began to track the tiger,” Mandy said. Rassie Erasmus, the owner of the animal, was present during the search, according to Mandy, who said Sheba was located near one of the houses on the farm. “Due to the terrain and area, it was not possible to contain her or secure her safely. At 3.45am, a decision was made to euthanise her while it was still safe to do so.” Since Sheba escaped from her enclosure, she had attacked 39-year-old William Mokoena, a pig and two dogs. Both dogs had to be put down due to the severity of their injuries. The 39-year-old Mokoena has since appointed a lawyer to sue the owner of the tigress.

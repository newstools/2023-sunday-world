Idols SA runner-up Brenden Praise and his content creator wife Nompumelelo “Mpoomy” Ledwaba recently celebrated six years of marital bliss. In 2021 the lovebirds, who have always maintained that they are grateful to God for their journey, held a traditional wedding as a celebration for their love. Taking to social media, Praise shared a picture of him and Ledwaba taken during their wedding six years ago. “Can’t believe it’s been six years. It would have been enough to spend a moment with you, to spend a lifetime is truly a blessing,” he wrote.  The couple once shared that they spent R10 000 on their wedding, which was attended by 50 guests, paid R900 for a bride’s dress and bought a suit for the groom at a Zara sale.

The Boksburg explosion death toll has increased from 34 to 37. Of the 37 who have died, 12 were healthcare workers, 10 were government employees and two were agency staff, all from Tambo Memorial Hospital – situated 100 metres from where the explosion happened. Additional body parts were also found around the area of the incident. Gauteng Premier Panyaza Lesufi expressed his sadness on Wednesday saying: “The provincial government confirms that the number of hospital staff members who were injured during the incident is 35, and not 13 as previously communicated. The 35 injuries are inclusive of those that demised.” On behalf of the provincial government, Lesufi extended his condolences to the families of the deceased and assured them of the continued support by the government during this difficult time. “We continue to stand with the many families whose lives have been changed forever by the tragic incident. This has not been an easy period, particularly for those who lost their loved ones. We implore our health professionals to provide the best care to those that are still on the road to recovery,” Lesufi said. He added that the antenatal clinic, operating theatre, outpatient department and maternity services have since resumed operations at the hospital. “Areas still affected include the accident and emergency unit, radiology and clinical departments including maternity services for high-risk patients.” The truck carrying a gas tanker, crashed into a low bridge in Boksburg on Christmas Eve, before the tanker exploded, leaving 10 people dead and dozens more severely injured at the scene.

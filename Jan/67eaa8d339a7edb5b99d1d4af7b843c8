British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe has confirmed that he is interested to buy Manchester United after the Glazer family, the owners of the English Premiership League side, announced in November 2022 that they are toying with an idea of putting the club up for sale. According to British outlet The Times, Ratcliffe’s company INEOS has officially entered the bidding to purchase the English giants, with many other stakeholders expected to enter the race. “We have formally put ourselves into the process of bidding,” said the spokesperson for the company. The latest developments follow calls for the Glazer family to step aside, which culminated in a protest by scores of United fans who expressed their opposition to the embattled club owners outside the Old Trafford Stadium in 2022.  Newly signed Al-Nassr forward Cristiano Ronaldo previously criticised the Glazer family during his controversial interview with Piers Morgan, saying the owners do not care about the football club. “The owners of the club, the Glazers, they don’t care about the club. Professionally and sportingly, they don’t really care in my opinion. I never even spoke to them, never!” said Ronaldo before his departure late in 2022. United are currently in a good run of form under manager Erik Ten Hag, unprecedently entering the title race alongside runaway leaders Arsenal and second-place Manchester City. Coming back from a big 2-1 Manchester derby win, Ten Hag and his charges will look to continue their winning momentum when they visit Patrick Viera’s Crystal Palace at the Selhurst Park Stadium on Wednesday night.

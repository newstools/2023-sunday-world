The Operation Vala Konke is yielding positive results after tik, nyaope, dagga and 319 litres of liquor were confiscated in Standerton, Mpumalanga on Monday. Police spokesperson in the province, Brigadier Selvy Mohlala, said police officials were conducting patrols in the area when they noticed a group of people who allegedly own an illegal liquor outlet. Following a search of the premises, a large volume of liquor was found and confiscated. “A 35-year-old man was arrested and paid a fine as an admission of guilt. Meanwhile, the second illegal liquor outlet was closed after [police] officers discovered that a specific spaza shop was used for trading liquor. A 33-year-old man was arrested and paid a fine as an admission of guilt,” Mohlala said. Two other suspects aged 23 and 30 were also arrested for theft in the area, and a 45-year-old man was nabbed for assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. The suspects were expected to appear at the Standerton magistrate’s court on Tuesday.

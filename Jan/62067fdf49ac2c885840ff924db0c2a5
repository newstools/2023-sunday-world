Portugal striker Christiano Ronaldo, who signed a three-year contract with Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr last week, may still compete in UEFA Champions League. According to media reports, a clause in Ronaldo’s contract states that he may still be eligible to play in Champions League if he is loaned to Newcastle United. However, his appearance in the European soccer spectacle depends on United, who are owned by the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund, finishing in the top four this season. The 37-year-old signed for Al-Nassr on Friday last week, after a long search for a new home following his dramatic exit from Manchester United. His departure from the Red Devils was as a result of a controversial interview with Piers Morgan ahead of the 2022 Fifa World Cup in Qatar. The veteran striker has signed a staggering €200-million per year contract valid until June 2025, making him the highest-paid athlete in the world. Ronaldo holds the record for being the all-time leading goal scorer in the Champions League with 140 goals, while his longest record-breaking competitor, Lionel Messi, is the closest to surpassing him with 129 goals, only 12 goals shy of the Portuguese. With Newcastle United in good form in the English Premier League and currently occupying position three on the log, Ronaldo will hope that the Magpies finish their league campaign in one of the Champions League spots. The Portugal captain landed in Saudi Arabia on Monday and is expected to undergo medical exam before being officially unveiled by his new club this week.

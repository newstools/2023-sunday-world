Portuguese football superstar Cristiano Ronaldo hit the ground running during his first training session with his new club in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. Moments after Ronaldo was presented to the Al-Nassr faithful and received a deafening warm welcome in a sold-out Mrsool Park Stadium, the 38-year-old was spotted in training.  His presentation saw thousands of supporters gather to welcome the biggest recruit at the club alongside Cameroon striker Vincent Aboubakar, who joined late in 2021, former Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina, Brazilian duo Luiz Gustavo and Anderson Talisca. The former Manchester United forward completed a lucrative move to the Saudi Pro League side last week and is expected to earn €200-million (R3.6-billion) per year. The deal is valid until 2025 and makes Ronaldo the highest-paid athlete in the world.   The five-time Ballon d’Or winner later expressed delight at joining the Middle Eastern side and brushed off the idea of triggering a clause in his contract that may see him play in Europe again. “My work in Europe is done. I played at the best clubs in the world, and I won everything. I’m happy and proud to join Al Nassr,” said Ronaldo during a media briefing. “People don’t know about the level [of football] here. This contract is unique because I am a unique player as well, so for me it’s normal.” Ronaldo has fixed his sights on making his debut when Al-Nassr, who are log leaders, welcome former Kaizer Chiefs striker Knowledge Musona’s Al Taee FC on Thursday.

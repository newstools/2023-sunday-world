Eastern Cape education MEC Fundile Gade described the late grade 12 exam marker and high school teacher Zisebenzele Mramba as a trusted soldier. Addressing mourners during Mramba’s funeral service on Tuesday, Gade said: “I am deeply saddened by the tragic loss of a life. The sector is in mourning. The deceased person was our trusted soldier that did an excellent job of marking the grade 12 scripts. “We pray for the family at this time and we will support [them] in every way possible. I also want to wish a speedy recovery to the [other female educator] in hospital, while thanking God for saving other two educators from this freak accident.” Mramba, who was a teacher at Zibokwana Senior Secondary School, died in a car accident on December 21 while travelling home from the Strelitzia marking centre in Kareiga, Uitenhage in the Eastern Cape. Reports indicate that another female teacher who was with Mramba when the accident occurred sustained injuries to the head and is fighting for her life in hospital. A case has been opened and the police are investigating the cause of the accident.

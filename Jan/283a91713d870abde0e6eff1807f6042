However, most people forget the everyday lunch box that needs to be given a priority. Chef Oageng Phofedi asserts that while “mistakes might happen, there is always a way out. Easy-to-prepare lunch boxes for scholars are the answer.” Phofedi says while everyone prepares to get back to classes, lunch boxes do not need to cost an arm and a leg, especially during the month that is believed to be longer than others. “These types of snack products are easy to find from local suppliers or supermarkets.

Mamelodi Sundowns coach Rulani Mokwena is not getting carried away by Swallows FC coach Ernst Middendorp’s utterances that the DStv Premiership race is done and dusted and that the Brazilians are as good as league champions. Middendorp was speaking after The Birds lost 2-0 to Sundowns at the Loftus Stadium on Tuesday evening, with the Brazilians consolidating a lead on top of the log by seven points via second-half goals by Neo Maema and Themba Zwane. Swallows are languishing in a danger zone, occupying position 15 on the log after 14 games and just two points away from Maritzburg United at the bottom of the table. “I have great respect for coach Ernst Middendorp and his opinions, but it is too early to say that the league is wrapped up, because there is still a long way to go,” Mokwena said. “I don’t think there has ever been a league title won in January, there are still so many games to go. Congratulations to our players, our technical team and the entire club, as well as Sundowns supporters. “It was an important win against a very difficult team. Swallows have improved a great deal and these are the kind of games that win you championships.” Mokwena also spoke about the changes that resulted in him assuming head coach responsibilities and his co-coaches Manqoba Mngqithi and Steve Komphela relegated to lower positions. “The change happened and the position [that I occupy] does not bring too much excitement, as long as the club keeps on winning and the supporters are happy. We have changed the structure and I must commend the players,” Mokwena said. For the latest sport news from Sunday World, click here.

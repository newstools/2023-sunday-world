Ntokozo Mdluli, popularly known by his stage name K.O, has cleared the air on claims that he stole his record-breaking song SETE. He wrote on his social media account that he bought the SETE beat on an online platform via Calliemajik‘s page, the original producer. K.O further wrote that he later discovered that other artists had used the beat, so he replaced some of the beats to come up with a unique sound. “I hold full unlimited rights to the licence of the instrumental I bought, which is why the artists who also put out their own versions rightfully cannot dispute mine, because we’re all governed by the same or lesser copyright. Normal practice in today’s music world,” he wrote.  For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here. Or read the latest from Shwashwi here.

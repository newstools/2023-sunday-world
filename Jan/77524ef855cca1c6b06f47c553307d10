Police officers at the Madeira Community Services Centre in Mthatha escaped a near-death incident when a man brandishing a knife stormed the cop shop and violently advanced toward the on-duty officers. According to a police report, the 31-year-old man’s confrontational behaviour on Monday led to police officers opening fire at him in self-defence. He died on the spot. A case of attempted murder and an inquest docket have been opened and the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) will investigate the circumstances surrounding the murder of the man. Provincial police spokesperson in the Eastern Cape, Brigadier Tembinkosi Kinana, said an investigation revealed that police officers were performing their duties when the man entered the station and behaved violently. “The investigation further revealed that before this particular incident, the suspect had stabbed his cousin, the mother and another family member from whom he allegedly robbed a handbag with money and other items including cellphones,” said Kinana. “The cellphones and bank cards were recovered by the police and were identified by members of the family. The knife used by the suspect was recovered and no injuries were reported on the side of the SAPS members in the police station.” All the police officers who were at the station at the time of the incident have been referred for counselling, added Kinana. The Eastern Cape provincial police commissioner, Lieutenant-General Nomthetheleli Mene, urged all police officers in the province to exercise extreme vigilance when carrying out their duties.

More than 100 teenagers from the age of 13 years gave birth on Christmas and New Year`s day during this festive period, said the Department of Health on Monday. The Department said it is concerned with the high rate of teen mothers as teen pregnancy and early motherhood contribute to interruption of formal education and dropouts by adolescent girls. “Some of them struggle to strike a balance between parenting and education due to lack of supporting family structure. This requires all hands on deck from government, families and other community structures to reduce school dropout which hinders formal education for many adolescent girls and young women, making them vulnerable to poverty.” The total number of children born on New Year’s Day was 1803 babies delivered at public health facilities in South Africa. “This translates into 22% increase from Christmas babies. Parents and caregivers are urged to consider exclusive breastfeeding and ensure their babies are fully immunised to strengthen their immune system to fight childhood diseases like polio and measles,” said the department.

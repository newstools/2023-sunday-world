The Hello hitmaker, Adele, has opened up about her struggles with a chronic back pain during her performance in Las Vegas on New Year’s Eve. The Grammy award-winning singer was seen struggling to walk across the stage when distributing T-shirts to concert goers. Adele then let the crowd in on her health condition, sciatica, complaining that it has made it difficult for her to move freely on stage. The thirty-four-year-old said: “I’ve just got to get over to the other side of the stage, I have to waddle these days, as I have really bad sciatica.” The Easy On Me singer, who has been battling back pains for almost two decades, shared that her struggles began when she was 15, after she slipped a disk while sneezing, adding that she has been in pain for “half of my life”. “It flares up, normally due to stress or from a stupid bit of posture,” she told the crowd, confessing that her recent 100-pound weight loss and intense exercise helped alleviate some of her health issues. “I got my tummy strong, down at the bottom, which I never had before, and my back doesn’t play up as much. It means I can do more, I can run around with my kid a little bit more.” Follow @SundayWorldZA on Twitter and @sundayworldza on Instagram, or like our Facebook Page, Sunday World, by clicking here for the latest breaking news in South Africa.

Marumo Gallants coach Dan Malesela has slammed the future of local football after his side suffered a 3-2 defeat to Sekhukhune United in a DStv Premiership encounter on Tuesday evening. As expected, Gallants dominated throughout the match, completing over 500 passes after regulation time, with their opponents only managing a total of 336 passes. Despite their dominance, Malesela’s charges failed to capitalise, leaving him frustrated and suggesting that the future of local football looks bleak. “I’m not a person who gets angry easily, I don’t get emotional often, particularly when it comes to matches and results of matches. But [really] if we are going to go on like this, our football is going nowhere,” Malesela said. “We are trying to build players, we are trying to build clubs that are strong, we work hard at training and if these games are not going to be decided by the players, then we are in big trouble.” He was, however, pleased about the overall performance of his players in the second half, saying he wished his side had applied the same pressure in the first stanza. The Limpopo-based outfit will look to bounce back and collect maximum points against a struggling Maritzburg United side at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium on Saturday.

The police in Gugulethu, Western Cape have cast their net wide in search of the suspects who ambushed three people on Sunday evening. Two of the victims died on the scene while a third one succumbed to gunshot wounds later in hospital. The police, who are following several leads, said the motive for the killing of the men, aged between 28 and 30, is yet to be determined. Speaking to Sunday World on Monday, Brigadier Novala Potelwa said a triple murder docket has been opened for investigation. “Reports from the scene indicate that the vehicle in which the deceased persons were travelling in had just entered NY6 at approximately 5.50pm when it came under fire from unknown gunmen who later fled in another vehicle. Numerous shots were fired at the vehicle wounding all the occupants,” said Potelwa. The incident is the second fatal shooting in the area since the beginning of the year. Last week, another mass shooting claimed the lives of three people.

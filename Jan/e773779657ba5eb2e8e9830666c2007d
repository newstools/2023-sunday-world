Two men who are linked to the murder of three people including an ANC ward councillor, Sbonelo Mthembu, have been arrested. The arrests come a day after Police Minister Bheki Cele visited the grieving families on Monday. During his visit, Cele said the police knew the names of the perpetrators. “The investigating team will have to do a thorough work. By the time those people get arrested, it should not be an arrest that will be followed by a withdrawal,” Cele said. Provincial police commissioner, Lieutenant-General Semakaleng Manamela, expressed her gratitude to the investigating team for apprehending the suspects, aged 43 and 52. “We have always stayed true and committed to our call of duty, that of preventing crime, and when crime has been committed we are obligated in terms of the constitution of the Republic of South Africa to investigate and bring the perpetrators to book,” said Manamela. “We still need the support from members of the public regarding further details that may assist in the investigation. We promise to treat such information with much delicacy.” The suspects were found with firearms and ammunition allegedly owned by a certain security company. A case of three counts of murder has been opened and the suspects are expected to appear at the Piet Retief magistrate’s court on Tuesday. According to a police report, Mthembu, Sandile Khumalo and Sizwe Mbingo were allegedly ambushed by armed men in Mkhondo, Piet Retief on Friday.

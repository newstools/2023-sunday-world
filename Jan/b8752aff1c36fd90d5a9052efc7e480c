Fatal road accidents over the festive season have jumped from 1 209 to 1 395 countrywide, according to the Road Traffic Management Corporation. Gauteng is currently leading the pack with 261 accidents followed by KwaZulu-Natal with 255 crashes and the Eastern Cape with 184. Despite an increase in fatal crashes, the KwaZulu-Natal MEC for transport, community safety and liaison, Sipho Hlomuka, has applauded road users in the province for the slight decline in accidents. The KwaZulu-Natal government had set itself a target of 10% reduction in road accidents and the indications point to a 13% reduction at the moment. “Whilst we are at a preliminary stage of the assessment with our performance, all indications are pointing to a decrease on both crashes and fatalities,” Hlomuka said. “We are, however, not taking our eyes off the ball, as our law-enforcement teams are still monitoring movement on the roads. “Our plan will be to monitor all our networks until the schools reopen. We are also encouraged by the work of our enforcement agencies.” The department appealed to road users to continue observing traffic rules, as many people head back to their places of work after the holidays.

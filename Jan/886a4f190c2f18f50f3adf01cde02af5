Three women are expected to appear at the Durban magistrate’s court soon following their arrest for being in possession of fraudulent SA Social Security Agency (Sassa) cards. The suspects were nabbed by an off-duty constable at an ATM on Tuesday, according to KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Colonel Robert Netshiunda. “The vigilant officer was at the Mangrove Centre in North Beach, Durban when she spotted three suspicious-looking women who were withdrawing money at an ATM. The officer requested back-up from the metro police officers who were in the vicinity and tactically approached the suspects,” said Netshiunda. The suspects, aged between 24 and 39, were using the Sassa cards to withdraw money from the ATM. “They were also found in possession of over R60 000 in cash, 32 Sassa cards, 22 bank cards from various banking institutions, as well as four cellphones. They will appear in the Durban magistrate’s court soon.”    Follow @SundayWorldZA on Twitter and @sundayworldza on Instagram, or like our Facebook Page, Sunday World, by clicking here for the latest breaking news in South Africa.

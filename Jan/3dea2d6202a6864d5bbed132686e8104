The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) in Mpumalanga has assured grant beneficiaries that the gold payment card is still valid and remains active despite an expiry date. “The beneficiaries must not panic or succumb to the hijacking by scammers and circulation of fake news that the card will expire in April 2023,” said the Sassa branch in Mpumalanga on Monday. The gold card can be used at the Postbank, ATMs and at various retail shops. The agency also encouraged the beneficiaries to provide their private bank accounts to Sassa as another safe, easy payment option, saying it will communicate changes, if there are any, in due course. “The fraudsters who pretend to be Sassa officials and target old-age people and people living with disability in their communities must be immediately reported to the police,” it said.

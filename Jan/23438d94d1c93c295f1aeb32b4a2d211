A case of murder against Sibusiso Kula, an ANC member of the National Assembly, has been postponed to Friday for a formal bail application. Kula allegedly killed his wife in November 2022 and the state intends to oppose his application for bail due to the seriousness of the matter. According to a police report, Kula’s wife was found murdered in what looked like a robbery gone wrong. She sustained a stab wound to the back, however, the object used to commit the crime was not found on the scene. Henry Mamothame, National Prosecuting Authority regional spokesperson, said the accused reported the murder to the police and informed them that he was not at home when his wife came under attack. “Following thorough investigations by the police, which linked him to the alleged murder, he was arrested on Friday last week and charged with murder,” said Mamothame. “Police investigations are still under way and Kula will remain in police custody until the next court appearance at the Orkney magistrate’s court in North West.” Follow @SundayWorldZA on Twitter and @sundayworldza on Instagram, or like our Facebook Page, Sunday World, by clicking here for the latest breaking news in South Africa.

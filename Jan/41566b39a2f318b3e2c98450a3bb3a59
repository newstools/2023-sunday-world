Amapiano vocalist Duduzile Ngwenya, affectionately known by her stage name Lady Du, is the latest victim of ATM robbery. On Tuesday morning, she took to her social media account to share her bad experience and to warn people to be extra vigilant when using ATMs. “Be careful at ATMs, I was helping a lady who was crying her eyes out. She said her husband hit her [and that] she needs [the school] money for her kids,” she wrote. “I went to the ATM to withdraw [the] money because I don’t carry cash, the next thing some guys snatched my wallet and belongings. When I looked to speak to the woman, she wasn’t there.” The Woza singer lost her driver’s licence and an ID as a result of being a Good Samaritan, she said. “They were working together because the CCTV footage shows them talking to each other [prior to the robbery].  It’s okay though, I learned my lesson. “I’m a God-fearing woman, this was the first time I experienced such, it doesn’t change my heart. Helping people is in my blood, I just need to be careful.”     For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here. Or read the latest from Shwashwi here.

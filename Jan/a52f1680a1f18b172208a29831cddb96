Post school education and training sector (PSET) is well-prepared to welcome new students at all its institutions, according to Blade Nzimande, Minister of Higher Education, Science and Innovation. “I must indicate that the matric pass rates for each province will be a helpful planning instrument for the post-school education and training sector for the further allocation of resources, particularly for our technical vocational education and training sector and our community colleges,” said Nzimande. The minister has advised all the students to contact their institutions, and that those who applied for financial assistance should contact the National Financial Aid Scheme to finalise their application processes. Nzimande also congratulated the 2022 matric class for attaining an 80.1% national pass rate amid the significant challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic and loadshedding. The minister is expected to host a media briefing on Tuesday to announce the PSET state of readiness for the 2023 academic year. For more education news from Sunday World, click here.

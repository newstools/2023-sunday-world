South African YouTuber and content creator Lasizwe Dambuza has waved goodbye to his comic alter ego Nomatriquency, as he leaves his channel. Reminiscing on his six-year long YouTube journey, Dambuza said he went through a lot in 2022 and ended up being depressed. On his emotional last YouTube video titled It’s the End, Dambuza said things have since changed because of time, noting that as a content creator, he has to move with the times. “Comedy for me is now my read point. The jokes that I used to make back then, I don’t think I can make them now,” he said. He further shared that he has put himself up for a challenge by creating a new YouTube channel, the African Network Channel. “I don’t know what the African Network Channel is, we’re going to figure it out along the way, and this [time] around I am not doing it alone, I am doing it with you guys. The channel is sitting on zero subscriber and the goal is to reach a million subscribers by the end of the year. “Thank you for coming along this journey with me, it’s not the end, it’s just the beginning of a new era.”    For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here.

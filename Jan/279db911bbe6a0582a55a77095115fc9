Defending champion Rafael Nadal has crashed out of the Australian Open after losing to American Mackenzie McDonald 6-4; 6-3; 7-5 at the Rod Laver Arena early on Wednesday morning (South African time). The 22-time Grand Slam champion was ultimately trailing by a set toward the end of the second set, before taking a medical time-out after sustaining what seemed like a hip injury. Nadal failed to defend his title after he opened his 2022 account with the Australian Open crown, beating second seed Daniil Medvedev 2-6, 6-7, 6-4, 6-4, 7-5. The shock defeat was the Spaniard’s first ever early exit in a competition since 2016, falling short at the hands of fellow countryman Fernando Verdasco in five grueling sets.  Speaking to the media after the game, McDonald was full of praise for Nadal and said he was gutted for him after the injury. “He’s an incredible champion, he’s never going to give up regardless of the situation. Closing it out against a top guy like that is always tough. I was focusing on myself at the end, and just got through. The injury, I hate that for him,” said McDonald. The 36-year-old will look to bounce back and hope to extent the men’s record of clinching 23 Grand Slam singles title with the Roland Garros set to take place on May 28 in Paris, France.

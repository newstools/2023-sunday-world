South Africa’s online driver’s licence renewal system has been labelled as anything but a “convenience”. Early on Wednesday, information was posted on the government social media account explaining that the online system would simplify the lives of motorists by allowing them to renew their licences with ease, register as road users or report a road crash. “Motorists will no longer have to wait in long queues to renew their driver’s licences, thanks to the road traffic management system which saves the time. The online Natis centres operate from Monday to Sunday,” according to the social media post. However, many motorists in KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga and Limpopo were left fuming after their attempts to use the online system amounted to nothing. They later discovered that their provinces are not registered on the app.     Follow @SundayWorldZA on Twitter and @sundayworldza on Instagram, or like our Facebook Page, Sunday World, by clicking here for the latest breaking news in South Africa.

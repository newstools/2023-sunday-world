Two men who are suspected of the murder of ANC ward councillor Sbonelo Ntshangase and his friends, Sandile Khumalo and Sizwe Mbingo, appeared briefly at the Piet Retief magistrate’s court on Monday. Blessing Ntombela and Blessing Dlamini, aged 30 and 38, face charges of murder and attempted murder. They were remanded in police custody until their next court appearance on January 30 for a formal bail application. So far, the police have arrested four suspects in connection with the killings, including former Mkhondo mayor Vusi Motha and his co-accused Wellington Sangweni, who were arrested last week. Brigadier Selvy Mohlala, spokesperson for police in Mpumalanga, said the victims were allegedly shot in Mkhondo on January 13. “It is alleged that the suspects fired multiple shots at Mr Ntshangase, who was in the yard and also shot Mr Mbingo, who was inside a bakkie.” said Mohlala. “Sadly [Mr Mbingo] died at the scene while Mr Khumalo was shot in the yard as well. Thereafter, the suspects fled in an unknown direction.” Follow @SundayWorldZA on Twitter and @sundayworldza on Instagram, or like our Facebook Page, Sunday World, by clicking here for the latest breaking news in South Africa.

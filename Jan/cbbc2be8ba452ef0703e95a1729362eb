The mother of the late Big Nuz member Mandlenkosi “Mampintsha” Maphumulo, Zamanguni Gumede, has passed away. Gumede, who was hospitalised at the Wentworth Hospital in Durban, died on Sunday after a short illness. Her death follows that of Mamphintsha who passed away on Christmas Eve. Gumede was visibly sick during the memorial service and funeral of Mampintsha and had to be supported by her family. A few weeks after Gumede was admitted to the hospitalised, her daughter Pinki pleaded with the public for help to mover her to a private hospital. Pinki revealed that Gumede was diagnosed with a stroke that also affected her liver. Gumede and her daughter-in-law, Bongekile, “Babes Wodumo” Simelane, smoked a peace pipe in public during the funeral of Mampintsha. For the latest entertainment news from Sunday World, click here.

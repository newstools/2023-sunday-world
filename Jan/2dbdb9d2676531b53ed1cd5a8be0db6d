A decision by pay-TV channel SuperSport to cancel indigenous languages in its football broadcasts is an assault and disparaging to black people, according to the Progressive Professional Forum (PPF). The think-tank organisation that represents black professionals was reacting to sweeping changes at SuperSport which will affect the coverage of Premier Soccer League matches in indigenous languages. The broadcaster said in a statement that vernacular commentary will be a thing of the past come Friday this week. “This decision will not shortchange viewers, but [will] offer them the same standard as delivered during the world cup. SuperSport will continue to evaluate and monitor its production decision on a regular basis,” reads a communique from the broadcaster. The broadcaster was, however, quick to point out that the decision was based on streamlining operations and delivering a better product for the viewer. However, the PPF has threatened to file a complaint with Chapter 9 institutions if SuperSport does not change its decision, saying the move is a declaration of war. “PPF views this as an insult, especially to black people and Africans who subscribe to SuperSport, all of whom are free to express themselves in their indigenous spoken or written [language],” said the think-tank in a statement, adding that it is also toying with an idea of mobilising the public and take the war to the broadcaster.

Cristiano Ronaldo’s long-awaited debut for Al-Nassr started with a 1-0 win over Ettifaq in the Saudi Pro League on Sunday. Ronaldo captained the team on his first start and was influential in their narrow victory, thanks to a first-half goal by Brazilian Anderson Talisca, who headed the ball at close range after it went past Ronaldo.  The Portuguese international signed for the Saudi Arabian side early in January, however, his debut was delayed by a two-match ban imposed by the English FA during his stint at Manchester United in 2022. The Saudi Arabian nation did nonetheless witness the Portuguese star in action during a combined XI from Al Nassr and Al Hilal in an exhibition game against Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) on Thursday. The match pitted the 37-year-old against Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and long-time rival Lionel Messi. Both Ronaldo and Messi were on the scoresheet in a nine-goal thriller, with PSG winning 5-4. Ronaldo is expected to lead his side in a top-of-the-table clash against Al-Ittihad on Thursday night. Al-Ittihad are currently third on the log with 31 points while Al-Nassr sit on top of the log with 33 points. For the latest sport news from Sunday World, click here.
